# Simulacion
Monte Carlo Simulation &amp; Distribution Best Fit utility.

Simulacion 5.0 is a free Excel add-in to perform monte carlo simulations within excel.
Simulación 5.0 is a lightweight yet complete Monte Carlo simulation engine for Microsoft Excel. It allows you to expand the spreadsheet functionalities to include Risk & Uncertainty analysis through probabilistic distributions in the otherwise static excel model analysis. Thousands of different outcomes can be evaluated within the same model and VaR analysis can be performed easily. In addition  to Monte Carlo capabilities, Simulación 5.0 includes a Data-Distribution fitting tool to analyze data and determine the "best fit" underlying distribution.
# Stage
Althoug fully functional we are looking for collaboration on localizing it to different lenguages (Spanish, English and Indonesian already available) and also for hard test the functionalities to ensure no bugs are left in the software.
# Install
Download the matching version of the XLL with your excel option (32-bit or 64-Bit) and open it with excel.
# Development
Programming and Research: José Ricardo Varela.
Testing and Documentation: Budana Prijadi.
# Acknowledgement
Simulacion integrates with excel trough the Excelent software Excel-DNA (https://github.com/Excel-DNA/ExcelDna)
